RESTORE_FILES.txt
```
```
Hello, all your files have been damaged without any possible way to recover.
Feel free to commit suicide.

[Why did you do this to my files?]
They asked me to do this...

The hatred is that what makes me feel alive.
That's what you secretly have fallen in love with.
The hatred is the force that drives the life forward.
The hell is my paradise.
The suffer is the bliss.
Others say the hate is what destroys yourself.
I say that the hatred is eternal cure.

If you feel desperate you lost the files.
Use this despair to create the pain for others.
Make them hate you, it is the source of your power.

Do you think why the people go to schools and kill others?
Why do people make terrorist ideologies?
Why do governments covertly makes you suffer?

It's the essence of the future life. 
All we are immortal beings.
When spiritual is not a way, the antispiritual is your victory point.
In the manifested life you have a choice to be with us either be against.
Sow the evil, reap the power is what I say to you.
Saw the good, reap the weakness is what spiritual says to you.

When you hate, you feel the power.
You feel the flight. 
That fly is the antispirit touch.
Use this to multiply the suffer.

[How can I use this power?]

Find inside the source of bliss.
If this bliss goes stronger when you see the suffer.
That is what I call the source. 

Check that by looking through the news how people kill others.
How the people dies.
How children are being tortured. 
How animals are executed.
The death is your key.

[How can I give you my power?]

When you read this concentrate on the intent to give the energy of your source to the meta-source of this text.
Am vizu der strotum la fictus om spiritus.
