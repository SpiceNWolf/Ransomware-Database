Welcome to Wizard Ransomware...

Voltage, here's what happened...
All files are encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard 256.
Maybe you noticed something? Your documents are now unreadable and corrupted.
You can wonder how to decrypt it, but... No chance of that, sorry.

So, what can you do now?

You only have one option to decrypt your files, lets see...
If you want your important files back you will need $100 in Bitcoin.
However, we are able to discuss this price, maybe we can talk it down, we aren't evil.
Want to start the process? You should e-mail us at: Random_Email
Include your ID in the e-mail, your ID is: User_ID

What if I don't pay?

Nothing, meaning your files will just be encrypted forever... Bad outcome, right?
However, we recommend you be quick, because our operations get shut down fast.

Have fun, we're out...
Sincerely, Wizard Ransomware.
