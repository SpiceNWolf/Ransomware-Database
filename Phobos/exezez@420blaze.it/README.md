All your files have been encrypted. 

At the moment there is no way to decrypt the data, except to request from us a decryptor and a key with which you will recover all your data. 
If you want to restore them, write to us by email: exezez@420blaze.it
For quick and convenient feedback, write to the online operator in the Telegram messenger: @exezaz
(Be careful when entering the Telegram account name, it must be exactly the same as above, beware of fake accounts.)
Specify this ID in the header of your message: User_ID
Also, from some mail services, your letter may not reach or get into spam, so to increase the likelihood of receiving a quick response, also duplicate your letters to our spare 
email addresses: helze@cyberfear.com and exezaz@msgden.com
Payment for decryption is made in bitcoins. In order to find out the price, write to the above contacts. The sooner you contact us, the lower the price will be. 
After payment, we will send you a tool that will decrypt all your files.

Free decryption as guarantee

Before paying you can send us up to 3 files for free decryption. The total size of files must be less than 4Mb (non archived), and files should not contain valuable information. (databases,backups, large excel sheets, etc.)

Attention!

To get guaranteed help in decrypting your files, please contact only the contacts listed in this note, because at the moment there are many scammers who, 
under the pretext that they can decrypt your data, request a free decryption through us and pass it off as a demonstration that they can decrypt your files.
Remember that the key for decrypting files is individual in each individual case, so you will not be able to decrypt your files yourself using third-party software, 
it will only spoil your files.
If you want to communicate through an intermediary, then check the price with our operator in advance, since intermediaries often wind up the real price.
!!! When contacting third parties, we do not guarantee the decryption of your files!!!
Also, to avoid problems with decryption, do not rename your files.
