Your computer is infected with a virus.
Files are locked* but not corrupted.

Send an email frankmoffit@aol.com and you will definitely be helped to recover.

*you can send us a couple of files and we will return the restored ones to prove that only we can do it

IMPORTANT:
1. the infection was due to vulnerabilities in your software
2. if you want to make sure that it is impossible to recover files using third-party software, do this not on all files, otherwise you may lose all data.
3. only communication through our email can guarantee file recovery for you. We are not responsible for the actions of third parties who promise to help you - most often they are scammers.
4. if we do not respond to you within 24 hours, send a message to the email blair_lockyer@aol.com or chocolate_muffin@tutanota.com or telegram acc - @phobos_support
5. if you need an alternative communication channel - write a request by e-mail
6. our goal is to return your data, but if you do not contact us, we will not succeed
