		   Attention!!!    
All your personal files (photo, documents, texts, databases, certificates, kwm-files, video) have been encrypted by a very strong cypher RSA-1024. The original files are deleted.  You can check this by yourself - just look for files in all folders.
 There is no possibility to decrypt these files without a special decrypt program! Nobody can help you - even don't try to find another method or tell anybody. Also after n days all encrypted files will be completely deleted and you will have no chance to get it back. 
 We can help to solve this task for 120$ via wire transfer (bank transfer SWIFT/IBAN). And remember: any harmful or bad words to our side will be a reason for ingoring your message and nothing will be done.
For details you have to send your request on this e-mail (attach to message a full serial key shown below in this 'how to..' file on desktop):   datafinder@fastmail.fm
